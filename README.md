This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Firebase's Realtime Database and its `onValue` listener. The bug manifests as a failure to update the UI with the latest data even though the data is correctly updated in the Firebase console. This is due to an outdated Firebase SDK version, showcasing the importance of keeping dependencies up-to-date for proper functionality. The solution involves upgrading to a more recent version of the Firebase SDK, resolving the data update inconsistency.  A comparison of the buggy and corrected code is included for educational purposes.
