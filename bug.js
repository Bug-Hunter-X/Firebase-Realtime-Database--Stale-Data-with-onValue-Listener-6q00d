In a Firebase project, I encountered an issue where data wasn't updating in real-time despite using the `onValue` listener.  The issue was particularly tricky because the data appeared to update correctly in the Firebase console, but not in my app. The problem stemmed from the fact that I was using an outdated version of the Firebase JavaScript SDK.  The old SDK had inconsistencies in handling data updates under certain network conditions. The code in question involved fetching data using `onValue` and then updating the UI accordingly. The `onValue` listener appeared to be functioning because it was logging the new data correctly, however, it was not correctly propagating the changes to the UI, resulting in a stale view.
